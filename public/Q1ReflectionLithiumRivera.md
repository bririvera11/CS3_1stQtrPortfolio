# QUARTER 1 REFLECTION BY RIVERA, BRIANNA ALIAH B. OF 9-LITHIUM

## 5 TOPICS I KNOW VERY WELL

> ***Appropriate Data Type***

- This topic consists of whether the given is a **number, string, boolean, undefined, null, NaN, etc**. I find this topic easy to grasp because they have certain ***characteristics that can help you identify which is which***. For example, if an expression contains ==, ===, or ! then the appropriate data type for it is boolean.

> ***Concatenation***

- Concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings. I know this topic very well because you only need to remember some rules. When the operator is **(+)** then the values combine **as it is** otherwise, the **string will be converted into a number**. However, if the **first string you plan to combine it with is not a number and the operator you got is not (+), then the value will return NaN**. That's the reason why I find it easy because ***if you get the main rules, then it wouldn't be hard at all.***

> ***Variable Declaration***

- Under this topic is the usage of var, let, and const. ***I believe that this topic is relatively easy compared to the previous rules in C++.*** The only thing you would need to remember is that **"let" cannot be used to re-declare a variable in the same scope.** If you want to use let and re-declare in the same scope, **just remove let for the second time.**

> ***Generating Output***

- I know this topic very well because ***frankly, it is the easiest one to grasp this quarter.*** Although there are many option, we barely use everything. The main ones that we use are **document.write and console.log** which ***aren't hard to remember.***

> ***Button to Function Call***

- Honestly, at first, this topic confused me so much to the point that I would always crash out because I couldn't understand it. However, ***the more that we practiced it became easier and eventually, it became muscle memory.*** I just needed to **understand and follow the format** when using it.

## 5 TOPICS I KNOW BUT NEEDS FURTHER PRACTICE

> ***For Loop***

- For this topic, **I understand the format or the way that you write it mainly due to its similiarity to the C++ For Loop function**. However, I believe that I still need further practice because ***I do not know when to and when to not use it.***

> ***While Loop***

- I find while loop relatively harder than For Loop. Although **I understand when to use a while loop,** ***I do not understand how to work it properly.*** I know the basics but when it becomes complex, ***it's hard to understand or it gets too overwhelming.***

> ***Do-While Loop***

- This one confuses me a lot! **I get the format** but similar to For Loop, ***I don't get when to and when to not use it***. Its ***difference from the While loop***, if there even is one, confuses me as well.

> ***Nested Loops***

- Compared to the other loops, **I understand when it is necessary** (which is kinda contradicting to my previous problems). However ***my main problem is the syntax.*** Sometimes I get it but most of the times, I get overwhelmed and confused.

> ***"!"***

- **I get it's usage** and how you use it to reverse the boolean expression. When **used alone I understand it** however, based on previous assessments, ***I get confused when there's more than one boolean expression.***

Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

## PLAN OF ACTION

> The main things I need to do is **treat coding (specifically loops) as a friend and practice more.** In the second part of this reflection paper, I realized that the main problem I have with loops is the fact that I get overwhelmed so easily. Whenever I see a coding problem that requires loop usage, I internally panic trying to think which one is of the best fit. The problem is, if I keep doing that, it will just make things more confusing and clouded; by trying to treat loops as a friend I can potentially decrease the chances of that scenario happening again. Another problem I faced based on section 2, is I lack practice. I know the basics but when complex problems come into the scenario, I do not know what to do. As my plan of action, I will try my best to practice coding every week. Even simple prompts that uses loops will be of great help for me.

## 2 EFFECTIVE ACTIVITIES

> ***Non-Graded Exercise 1***

- Out of all our exercises, I believe that this non-graded exercise helped me the most. It was effective because at first, we had to "experiment" or try it on our own before ma'am explained it. Speaking of explanation, I believe that another reason as to why this was so effective is because of the explanation and alternate solution that ma'am Aline provided us with.

> ***Concatenation Lecture/Exercise***

- This exercise was truly effective for me because I got it instantly. Because of the amount of problems and scenarios given during the lecture, I understood the concept of concatenation.

## 2 NON-EFFECTIVE ACTIVITIES

> ***Long Lectures***

- For me, long lectures don't really work as well as when we have to do something in class with the guidance of the teacher. I believe it's just a personal choice given that I am a very visual learner, so if I just listen I wouldn't get much from the lecture.

> ***None***

- Other than the long lectures where we have to just sit in listen, I can't think of anymore ineffective activities that we did. Most (again, aside from the lectures) are okay and understandable to a certain extent.
